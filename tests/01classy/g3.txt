TABLET III
THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH
Translated by William Muss-Arnolt
1901

A great and important factor in the subsequent adventures of Gilgamesh is the fact that Enkidu becomes the friend and companion of the hero. Two fragments, published on pages 14 and 15 of Professor Haupt's edition, are supposed by Dr. Jeremias to have belonged to Cols. III and IV of this tablet. The former seems to be an address to a woman (the Shamhat?):

* * * the gods let thee enter
* * * forsaken was
* * * the consort * * *
* * * and he saw it alone,
and he relieved his heart and spoke to his friend.
* * * a dream I dreamed in my night's sleep, 
[The stars?] of heaven fell upon the earth. 
[Frightened?] I stood there.
* * * his face became disturbed
* * * like lion's claws were his nails
* * * the dream?] strengthened me * * *

The second fragment was a dialogue between Shamash, the sun god, and Enkidu, in consequence of which Enkidu's "angry heart became quieted." It seems that Shamash induced Enkidu, who is anxious to return to his mountain home, to remain. The Shamhat again plays a prominent role, and we hear of the promise to Enkidu of royal honours, the friendship and brotherly love of Gilgamesh. Says Shamash:

"Come, and on a fine, grand couch,
on a fine couch he [Gilgamesh] will let thee recline.
He will place thee upon a couch, a seat to the left.
The kings of the earth shall kiss thy feet.
The people of Uruk shall whine before thee * * *
and the nations shall work for thee.
* * * after thee shall be carried, whatever there be
* * * in the midst thereof he shall encamp."
Enkidu listened to the word of Shamash, the warrior hero,
* * * his angry heart became quieted.

A continuation of this tablet Dr. Jeremais believes to have found on page 87 of Haupt's edition. Here Gilgamesh promises to Enkidu precisely the same that Shamash promises on page 15 (see above). The gods have a purpose in view in bringing about friendship between Enkidu and Gilgamesh. The fragments of Tablets IV and V give us the key to it. They relate the battle of the city of Uruk against the Elamitic despot Humbaba, ending in the death of the latter and the enthronement of Gilgamesh as King of Uruk. The gods, being deeply interested in the destruction of Humbaba and the end of the rule of the hostile god [giant] Humba, take part in the fight. It is evident that this poetic narrative is simply the mythical representation of a great national upheaval, by means of which an Elamitic dynasty was overthrown and a Babylonian rule established.
