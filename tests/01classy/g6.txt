TABLET VI
THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH
Translated by William Muss-Arnolt
1901

narrates the celebration of the victory of Gilgamesh, and his repulse of Ishtar's love advances (Haupt, pp. 42-50).

He cleansed his weapons, he polished his arms.
He took off the armour that was upon him. He put away
his soiled garments and put on clean raiment;
clothed himself with his ornaments, put on his diadem (?).
Gilgamesh placed upon his head the crown and put on his diadem (?). 
To win the favour and love of Gilgamesh, Ishtar, the lofty goddess desired (and said unto him): 
"Come, Gilgamesh, be thou my spouse, 
Give, O give unto me thy manly strength. 
Be thou my husband, let me be thy wife, and I will set thee in a chariot (embossed) with precious stones and gold, 
with wheels made of gold, and shafts of sapphires (?). 
Large kudanu-lions thou shalt harness to it. 
Under sweet-smelling cedars thou shalt enter into our house.
And] when thou enterest into our house 
Thou shalt sit upon?] a lofty throne, and people shall kiss thy feet; 
kings and lords and rulers shall bow down before thee. 
Whatever mountain and country produces, they shall bring to thee as tribute.
* * *] thy sheep shall bear twin-ewes.
* * *] mules they shall bring as tribute.
Thy [majesty?] shall sit upon a chariot that is splendid, 
drawn?] by a span that has no equal.
But Gilgamesh opened his mouth and spoke unto her; said unto the lofty goddess Ishtar:

The beginning lines of his speech are almost lost, only a few fragments being preserved. Gilgamesh refused the proffered love of Ishtar, reminding her that all her former lovers have come to grief through her, and said that he was not willing to share their fate.

"Where is thy husband Tammuz, who was to be forever? 
What, indeed, has become of the allallu-bird * * *? 
Well, I will tell thee plainly the dire result of thy coquetries.
To Tammuz, the husband of thy youth, 
thou didst cause weeping and didst bring grief upon him every year.
The allallu-bird, so bright of colours, thou didst love; 
But its wing thou didst break and crush, 
so that now it sits in the woods crying: 'O my wing!' 
Thou didst also love a lion, powerful in his strength, 
seven and seven times didst thou dig a snaring pit for him.
 Thou didst also love a horse, pre-eminent in battle, 
but with bridle (?), spur, and whip thou didst force it on, 
didst force it to run seven double-leagues at a stretch. 
And when it was tired and wanted to drink, thou still didst force it on,
thereby causing weeping and grief to its mother Si-li-li. 
Thou didst also love a shepherd of the flock * * * 
who continually poured out incense before thee, 
and, for thy pleasure, slaughtered lambs day by day. 
Thou didst smite him, and turn him into a tiger, 
so that his own sheep-boys drove him away, 
and his own dogs tore him to pieces. 
Thou didst also love a farmer, a gardener of thy father, 
who continually brought unto thee dainties, 
and daily adorned thy table for thee. 
Thine eye thou didst cast on him and turn his mind, saying: 
'Oh, my farmer boy, let us enjoy thy manly strength. 
Let thy hand come forth and take away my virginity' (?).
But the farmer spoke unto thee and said:
'Me!—what is this that thou askest of me?
Mother, thou hast not baked, and I will not eat;
The food that I shall eat is bad and bitter,
and it is covered with cold and numbness.' 
And when thou didst hear such words,
thou didst smite him and change him into a cripple(?)
And didst thus compel him to lie on a couch,
so that he could no more rise up from his bed.
And now thou wouldst also love me; but like unto them I would fare." 
When Ishtar heard such words
she became enraged, and went up into heaven,
and came unto Anu [her father], and
To Antum (her mother) she went, and thus spoke (unto them):
"My father, Gilgamesh has insulted me; 
Gilgamesh has upbraided me with my evil deeds, 
my deeds of evil and of violence." 
And Anu opened his mouth and spoke— 
said unto her, the mighty goddess Ishtar: 
"Thou shalt not remain so disconsolate, 
even though Gilgamesh has upbraided thee with thy evil deeds,
thy deeds of evil and of violence." 
And Ishtar opened her mouth and said, 
she spoke unto Anu, her father: 
"My father, create [for me] a heaven-bull." 

The following seventy lines have come down in a very mutilated condition; and the meaning can only be surmised. As Dr. Jeremias has ingeniously pointed out, the lines remind us of the threat of Gilgamesh, spoken before the ocean palace (Tablet X, Col. I), and especially of the analogous conditions found in the account of the "Descent of Ishtar into the Netherworld," where the courageous goddess in her wrath forces entrance to the Netherworld. As she threatened there, so now here, in heaven, she would smash everything, if her will and wish is not granted. Anu, her father, though hesitating, is forced to accede and creates the heaven-bull. And now Ishtar breaks out in these words: "I will have revenge." The account of the fight of the two heroes, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, against the heaven-bull is almost completely lost. Lines 122 and 123 appear to say:

They?] hunted him and Enkidu [attacked?] the heaven-bull, 
* * * and grasped him by his heavy tail.

On an old Babylonian cylinder representing the fight we see the bull standing on its hind feet, Enkidu holding the monster by its head and tail, while Gilgamesh plunges the dagger into its heart. We can also gather from the remains of the lines that three hundred heroes took part in the fight. After the heroes had killed the bull and had thus satisfied their hearts, they brought unto Shamash, the sun god, a thank offering. The narrative then continues:

Then Ishtar went up to the wall of Uruk, the strong-walled;
she uttered a piercing cry and broke out into a curse, (saying):
"Woe to Gilgamesh, who thus has grieved me,
and has killed the heaven-bull."
But Enkidu, hearing these words of Ishtar,
tore out the right side of the heaven-bull,
and threw it into her face, (saying):
"And thus I will, indeed, defeat thee;
and I will do unto thee even as I have done to him; 
I will hang its heart(?) upon thy side, forsooth."
Then Ishtar gathered her followers, that ruin men,
the hierodules and the sacred prostitutes.
Over the right side of the heaven-bull she wept and lamented.
But Gilgamesh assembled the people, and all his workmen.
The workmen admired the size of its horns.
Thirty minas of precious stones was their value;
half of an inch (?) in size was their thickness (?).
Six measures of oil they both could hold.
For the anointing of his god Lugal-tur-da8 he dedicated it.
He brought the horns and hung them up in the shrine of his lordship.
Then they washed their hands in the river Euphrates,
took the road, and set out (for the city),
and rode through the streets of the city of Uruk.
The people of Uruk assembled and looked with astonishment [at the heroes?].
Gilgamesh then spoke to the servants (?) of [his palace?]
and cried out unto them, (saying):
"Who is glorious among the heroes?
Who shines among the men?"
"Gilgamesh?] is glorious among the heroes,
Gilgamesh?] shines among the men!"

[Lines 204 to 206 are lost.]

and Gilgamesh held a joyful feast in his palace. 
Then the heroes slept, stretched out upon their couches. 
And Enkidu slept, and saw a vision in his sleep. 
He arose (in the morning) and "solved" the dream, 
and spoke unto Gilgamesh thus: 
"My friend, wherefor have the great gods thus taken counsel?" 

The last line of the sixth tablet represents, no doubt, the beginning of the next (the seventh) tablet. This line is followed as usual by the colophon, thus:

The sixth tablet of: "He who has seen the history of Gilgamesh."
