TABLET I
THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH
Translated by William Muss-Arnolt
1901


Of this tablet only a few fragments are preserved. The correct beginning of the first tablet has been determined by Professor Haupt. It reads thus:

He who has seen the history of Gilgamesh, 
[He who] knows all [that has happened to him] 
* * * together * * *
[He who] has seen all kinds of wisdom, 
[and] knows the mysteries and has seen what is hidden, 
he bringeth news dating farther back [than the deluge?]; 
He has travelled far-distant roads, 
and become weary * * * 
[and now he has written] on a memorial tablet all the other things
* * * the wall of Uruk-supuru 

[Lines ten and eleven are wanting.]

He spoke a charm which does not leave [him]
* * * the god who from distant days * * *

So far page 1 of Haupt's text; to the same tablet, as Haupt and Jeremias have pointed out, belongs page 51, narrating a siege of the city of Erech.

* * * his cattle forsook him.
* * * he went down to the river,
pushed into the river his boat and covered (it).
* * * full of sorrows he wept bitterly.
He returned (?) to the city of Gan-gan-na, which the enemy had destroyed completely.
The she-asses have trampled down their foals; 
The cows in madness turn upon their calves. 
And as the cattle were frightened, so were the people. 
Like the doves, the maidens sigh and mourn. 
The gods of Uruk, the strong-walled,
 Assume the shape of flies and buzz about the streets. 
The protecting deities of Uruk, the strong-walled, 
take on the shape of mice and hurry into their holes. 
Three years the enemy besieged the city of Uruk; 
the city's gates were barred, the bolts were shot. 
And even Ishtar, the goddess, could not make head against the enemy.
But Bel opened his mouth, said 
to Ishtar, the queen, and spoke to her thus: 

[The rest of the text is broken off; traces still allow to read (21) "Babylon the city of joy" (?). The death of the king must have created consternation in the city, described above, so graphically. Then Gilgamesh comes to the city as her saviour, and later on appears as her king.]
