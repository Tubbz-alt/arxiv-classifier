TABLET V
THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH
Translated by William Muss-Arnolt
1901

Col. I. The heroes are in the sacred forest, surrounding the stronghold of Humbaba. They had apparently forced open its gate:

There they stood, lofty arose the forest, and
(astonished) they gazed at the height of the cedars
and at the entrance of the cedar wood,
where Humbaba was wont to walk with lofty steps.
Ways were laid out and paths well kept.
They saw the cedar hill, the dwelling of gods, the sanctuary
of Ernini. In front of the hill (mountain) a cedar stood of great
splendour, fine and good was its shade, filling with gladness (the heart?).

The remainder of the column is broken off, but it probably gave a further description of the palace and its surroundings.

Page 27 contains fragments of an address by Gilgamesh to Enkidu in which again is mentioned

The corpse to be devoured by the vultures.

In Cols. II and III (pp. 25 and 28, and perhaps also pp. 74 and 86) the heroes recount their former glorious deeds, a favourable indication for the success of their imminent battle with Humbaba. Of the other columns only a fragment of the closing lines of Col. V is preserved (p. 26), where, in the last line, the "head of Humbaba" is mentioned, a fact which proves that the preceding lines contained an account of the fight and slaying of Humbaba. Immediately upon this line follow, according to the custom of Babylonian scribes, two lines, one giving the first line of the next (VI) tablet, and the other stating that it was the V tablet of the whole series, the words of the first line of Tablet I being used as "catchword" for the whole epic. Both served as a guide for the reader of the whole series.
