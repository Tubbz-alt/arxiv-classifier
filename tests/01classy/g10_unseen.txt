TABLET IX

begins with the lament of Gilgamesh for the death of his friend, and with his resolve to go to his ancestor Utnapishtim, that he may learn the mystery of the latter's apotheosis, and, at the same time, secure recovery from a loathsome disease, with which Ishtar has smitten him.

Gilgamesh wept bitterly over the loss of his friend
Enkidu, and he lay stretched out upon the ground, (saying):
"I will not die like Enkidu,
But weeping has entered into my heart;
Fear of death has befallen me, and
I lie here stretched out upon the ground.
To (test) the strength of Utnapishtim, the son of Kidin- Marduk, 
I will set out, and I will go at once." 
"At the mountain ravine I arrived by night-time,
* * * Lions I saw, and I was afraid;
* * * but I lifted my head to god Sin and I prayed.
To the [great?] majesty of the god came my cry, 
[and he hearkened] and saved me, even me." 
And in the night he saw?] a vision and a dream, 
Lions * * *] were enjoying themselves." 
And he lifted the axe in his hand, 
and drew out the sword from his belt. 
Like a javelin he threw himself between them; 
he wounded, killed, and scattered [them?] 

[The rest of the column is lost.]

Col. II narrates the meeting of Gilgamesh with the scorpion-men, at the foot

of a mountain whose name is Mashu.
As he came to the mountain of Mashu,
whose entrance is guarded daily by monsters,
whose back extends to the dam of heaven,
and whose breast reaches down to Aralu,
Scorpion-men guard its gate;
Dreadful terror they spread, and it is death to behold them.
Their splendour is fearful, overthrowing the mountains;
From sunrise to sunset they guard the sun.
Gilgamesh beheld them, and with fear
and terror his face grew dark.
His mind became confused at the wildness of their aspect.
But one scorpion-man said to his wife:
"He that there cometh to us, flesh of the gods is his body."
And the wife answered the scorpion-man: 
"Two (thirds) he resembles a god, and one third only a man."
And the scorpion-man replied and said unto her: 
["One] of the gods has given the order; 
[and] he has travelled over far-distant roads, 
until he should come unto me. 
The mountains] which he has crossed are steep." 

[The remainder is broken away.]

Col. III, as far as the fragments permit us to see, narrates that Gilgamesh, seeing that the monster regarded him with friendly eyes, recovered from his fright and told the scorpion-man of his intention to go “to Utnapishtim, his ancestor, who had been removed into the assembly of the gods and [had thus power over] life and death." The scorpion-man replied by describing to Gilgamesh the difficulties and dangers connected with such a march through the mountain of Mashu. Nobody has yet been able to do so, twelve miles of heavy darkness in all directions having to be penetrated. But the hero was not discouraged, and the scorpion-man acceded to his urgent request and opened to him the gate of the mountain; and now begins the wearisome march:

One mile he marches, thick is the darkness, not does it grow light. 
Two miles he marches, thick is the darkness, not does it grow light.

Col. V (p. 65) continues the description of the twelve-mile walk in the same diffuse epic style; then the hero leaves the mountain and—on the shore of the sea—beholds a beautiful and wonderful tree:

And as he saw it, he ran toward it.
Diamonds (?) it bore as fruit,
Branches were hanging (down?), beautiful to behold.
Crystal (antimony?) the branches bore;
with fruit it was laden, dazzling the eye (of the hero).
Other precious trees are also there. 

In Col. VI Gilgamesh must have reached the seacoast, for

TABLET X

commences, as shown in the colophon to Tablet IX:

The (divine) girl Siduri, sitting upon the throne of the sea,

probably a poetic expression for the ocean-palace, in which she resides, as we are told later. In Col. II, Gilgamesh finds another obstacle in his way, as he arrived "clothed with a skin." Again, he began to lament and was angered at the " distant roads " that he had yet to travel.

Sirudi sees him from afar off, 
and she speaks to herself 
and [takes counsel] with herself: 
"Because this * * * 

How shall he succeed (?) in [his endeavour?] 
And as Sirudi sees him approach she closes [her ocean- 
palace?] 

Its gate she closes and closes * * * 
But Gilgamesh listens to * * * 
Lifts up his finger (?) and * * * 
Then Gilgamesh spoke unto Sirudi and said: 
"Sirudi, what doest thou gaze [at me?]. 
Why doest thou bolt the gate against me?]; 
For I will break [thy gate" 

The lower part of the plate is destroyed, and we can only conjecture that Sirudi described to the hero the impossibility of continuing his journey, which would lead him across an impassable sea. In Col. II the hero again tells the reason for his journey, and laments the loss of his beloved friend, Enkidu, who has now returned to dust, and to share whose lot seems unbearable to him.

And Gilgamesh said unto her, the Sirudi:
Tell me, O Sirudi, which is the way to Utnapishtim?
What is its direction, O Sirudi, tell me its direction.
If it be possible, I will cross the sea;
But if it is impossible, I will run there across the field."
And Sirudi answered unto Gilgamesh, and said:
"Gilgamesh, there has never been a crossing (here),
and no one since eternal days has ever crossed the sea.
Shamash, the hero, crosses it; but besides Shamash who
can cross it? Difficult is the crossing, and extremely dangerous the way,
and closed are the Waters of Death,which bolt its entrance.
How, then, Gilgamesh, wilt thou cross the sea? 
And if thou should'st reach the Waters of Death, what wouldst thou do? 
But Gilgamesh, there is Urshinabi, the sailor of Utnapishtim 
at the side of those with stones'; in the forest he fells a cedar.
Him may thy countenance behold. 
If possible, cross over with him; but if impossible, go back."
When Gilgamesh heard this, 
he lifted up the axe at his arm, 
drew the sword from his belt, slipped in and descended to [***]; 
and fell like a javelin between them.

The hero stands at the entrance to the Waters of Death, which are supposed to surround the ocean. The "Isle of the Blessed" is thought to be beyond these Waters of Death, just as in the case of the Netherworld. In Col. III Gilgamesh tells Urshinabi of his grief, using undoubtedly the same words as before, and closes with the request to ferry him over.

Urshinabi said unto Gilgamesh:

"Thy hand, O Gilgamesh, has prevented [the crossing].
Thou hast smashed 'those with stones' * * *
'Those with stones ' are now smashed and the * * * is no more.
Take, Gilgamesh, the axe at thy side, 
go into the wood and make one hundred and twenty oars [punting-poles] five gar long."

He is also to make other preparations for his journey.

And Gilgamesh on hearing this (i. e., Urshinabi's instructions),
took the axe at his side, and [drew the sword from his belt].
He went into the woods and felled trees for one hundred and twenty oars five gar in length,
smeared them over with pitch and brought them [to Urshinabi].
Then Gilgamesh and Urshinabi embarked;
the ship tossed to and fro while they were on their way.
A journey of forty and five days they accomplished within three days,
and thus Urshinabi arrived at the Waters of Death.

And now they begin to face the most serious dangers. Col. IV relates that the ferryman advises the hero not to give in, as long as the journey upon the Waters of Death lasts. Many a day they spent on their journey, and day after day Gilgamesh stuck to the oar;

and then Gilgamesh loosened his belt (i. e., rested from his exertions), 
for he was weary.
And Utnapishtim looking at him from the distance 
Began thinking within himself, and 
With himself he thus meditated: 
"Why are ['those with stones'] of the ship smashed? 
And one, who has not my * * * rides in [the ship]. 
He that comes there [is he?] not a man, and has he not 
the 'right side' of a man?
I look: (Is that) * * * not [a human being?] 
I look: (Is that) * * * not [a man?] 
I look: (Is that) * * * [not a god?] 
He resembles me in every respect." 

At the beginning of Col. V, Gilgamesh drew nigh unto the shore safely and, while still sitting in the ship, he poured out his tale of woe before his ancestor; he told him of the adventures which he and his friend had encountered, among which was one with a " panther of the field "; then follows an account of the killing of the heaven-bull; the slaying of Humbaba, the despot, who had lived in a cedar forest; other adventures with tigers; his friend's sickness and sad death; and "now I weep because of him"; then he tells how he had wandered across all the countries, passed over steep mountains, and crossed dreadful seas, but all in vain:

"The friend whom I loved has been turned to clay; Enkidu, my friend. 
And I will not, like unto him, lie down; not will I sink to where my friend is now." 
And Gilgamesh said unto Utnapishtim: 
"Here I have come, and Utnapishtim, whom people call the 'distant,' I will see. 
To him I will turn (for help?); I have travelled through all the lands,
I have crossed over the steep mountains, and I have traversed all the seas," etc.

Col. VI must have contained a lengthy reply of Utnapishtim, telling him that he could do nothing to help him to escape from death. He told him that death comes to all, that none could escape from it.

As long as houses are built, as long as tablets are sealed,
as long as brothers are at enmity,
as long as there exist strife and hatred in the land,
as long as the river carries the waters (to the sea?), etc.,
so long is there no likeness of death drawn (i. e., no man can tell when his own time might come). 
When the alu-demon and the eziz-demon greetaman, 
then the Anunnaki, the great gods [assemble] 
and the goddess of fate, she who with them determines fate, will do so,
For they determine death and life. 
But the days of death are unknown to mankind. 

Then follows the colophon stating that this was the tenth tablet of the great epic.
