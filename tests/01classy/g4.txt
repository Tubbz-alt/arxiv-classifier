TABLET IV
THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH
Translated by William Muss-Arnolt
1901

is represented by only a few small fragments, which, however, enable us to see that the tablet describes the preparation for the capture of the fortress of the Elamitic king, Humbaba. These two tablets (IV and V) then contain the historic kernel of the narrative of the epic. According to Dr. Jeremias, Tablet IV contained something like this: Col. I. Enkidu stands before the king of the gods (Marduk?), speaking probably of Humbaba, whom he and Gilgamesh intended to kill, and whose corpse vultures (?) may devour; they asked the god to be favourable to their fight.

We did look after thee, O king [of the gods?]. 
Now look thou also after us. 
Gilgamesh then advises Enkidu to go 
To the lofty palace of the great queen, who knoweth all. 

Thereupon both go to the great prophetess, who is described in Col. II, her breast ornaments and her crown being especially mentioned. After this the narrative continues as follows:

[Before] Shamash he sacrificed a smoke-offering,
poured out a drink-offering;
lifted up before Shamash his hand,1 (praying):
"Why hast thou disquieted the heart of Gilgamesh?
Now thou hast taught him, and
a far road he travels unto Humbaba.
An unknown fight he is about to enter,
To an unknown war he is about to set forth.
From the day that he goeth, until he returneth again,
until he comes to the (splendid) cedar wood,
until he shall have killed Humbaba the despot,
all the many evils which shall befall him, shall ruin him.
On the day when thou * * *

The end of Col. II narrates the preparation for the great fight.

The forces of the country assembled together; 
the army completed its preparations; 
and the heroes put on their armour. 

Then the two friends set out together. Col. V opens with these words:

In order that the cedar wood remain intact, Bel has made it a terror for the people.
The roaring of Humbaba was like that of a storm cyclone; 
his mouth was (full of) blasphemy, his breath (killing?)
like hot wind;
* * * hears a roaring in the forest; 
whosoever descends into his park. 
In order that the cedar forest remain intact, Bel has 
made it a terror for the people. 
Whosoever enters it, pestilence (?) will overtake him. 
And Gilgamesh spoke unto Enkidu, and said: 

Plates 57 and 58 Dr. Jeremias assigns to the last column of Tablet IV. Gilgamesh recounts to Enkidu

a favourable dream, 
a splendid dream,

in which he saw the corpse of Humbaba. Then they set out on their way in the morning;

every twenty double leagues they took a meal;
every thirty double leagues they took a rest.
Before Shamash they dug a hole.
Then Gilgamesh went up to * * *
and poured his sacrificial meal into the hole (saying):
"Mountain, bring a dream unto Enkidu!
Let him see dream-visions, O Shamash."

Then they go to sleep. About midnight Gilgamesh awakes, arises, and speaks to his friend Enkidu:

"My friend, hast thou called me?" Then he tells him of a
third dream that he had seen.
The dream that I dreamed was very terrible (?);
heaven thundered, earth quaked;
day grew dark, darkness came up;
lightning set in, fire flared up
sated [with destruction] and filled with death.
Then suddenly the light darkened, the fire was quenched
* * * fell down, turned into smoke * * *”
Enkidu heard this dream and said to him:

The face [of Gilgamesh was grieved].
[He spoke] to Enkidu:
[“My friend, why are] thy eyes
[Filled with tears]?
Thy [heart clutched]
Dost thou sigh [sadly(?)]?”
[Enkidu opened his mouth] and
spoke to Gilgamesh:
“Attacks, my friend,
have exhausted my strength(?).
My arms are lame,
my strength has become weak.”
Gilgamesh opened his mouth and
spoke to Enkidu:

Enkidu opened his mouth and
spoke to Gilgamesh:
 “Know, my friend, in the mountain,
when I moved about with the cattle
to a distance of one double hour into the heart of the forest,
 [Alone?] I penetrated within it,
 [To] Ḫumbaba, whose roar is a flood,
whose mouth is fire,
whose breath is death.
Why dost thou desire
To do this?
To advance towards
the dwelling(?) of Ḫumbaba?”
Gilgamesh opened his mouth and
 [spoke to Enkidu:
“... [the covering(?)] I will destroy.
....[in the forest]

The dwelling [of Ḫumbaba]

Enkidu opened his mouth and
spoke to [Gilgamesh:]
 “When [together(?)] we go down

Ḫumbaba, an offspring(?) of .... 
Adad ......................

To keep safe [the cedar forest],
 [Enlil has decreed for it] seven-fold terror.”
Gilgamesh [opened] his mouth and
spoke to [Enkidu]:
 “Whoever, my friend, overcomes (?) [terror(?)],
it is well (for him) with Shamash for the length of [his days].
Mankind will speak of it at the gates.
Wherever terror is to be faced,
Thou, forsooth, art in fear of death.
Thy prowess lacks strength.
I will go before thee.
Though thy mouth calls to me; “thou art afraid to approach.”
If I fall, I will establish my name.

whose name fills the lands.
I will lure him to the cedar forest,
Like a strong offspring of Uruk. 
I will let the land hear (that)
I am determined to lure (him) in the cedar (forest).
A name I will establish.”
The elders of Uruk of the plazas
brought word to Gilgamesh:
 “Thou art young, O Gish, and thy heart carries thee away.
Thou dost not know what thou proposest to do.
We hear that Humbaba is enraged.
Who has ever opposed his weapon?
To one [double hour] in the heart of the forest,
Who has ever penetrated into it?
Ḫumbaba, whose roar is a deluge,
whose mouth is fire, whose breath is death.
Why dost thou desire to do this?
To advance towards the dwelling (?) of Ḫumbaba?”
Gilgamesh heard the report of his counsellors.
He saw and cried out to [his] friend:
 “Now, my friend, thus [I speak].
I fear him, but [I will go to the cedar forest(?)];
I will go [with thee to the cedar forest].

At the rampart of [Uruk of the plazas],
Gilgamesh kneeled down [before Shamash(?)],
A word then he spoke [to him]:
 “I will go, O Shamash, [thy] hands [I seize hold of].
When I shall have saved [my life],
Bring me back to the rampart [in Uruk].
Grant protection [to me ?]!”
Gilgamesh cried, "[my friend] ......

 [For] the road they counselled Gilgamesh:
 “Do [not] rely, O Gilgamesh, on thy strength!

May he level the road for thy treading!
May he level the mountain for thy foot!
During thy night the word that wilt rejoice

Round about thee dig a well!
May there be pure water constantly for thy libation
Goblets of water pour out to Shamash!
 [May] Lugal-banda take note of it!”
 [Enkidu] opened his mouth and spoke to Gilgamesh:
“[Since thou art resolved] to take the road.
Thy heart [be not afraid,] trust to me!
 [Confide] to my hand his dwelling(?)!”
 [on the road to] Ḫumbaba they proceeded.
