TABLET II
THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH
Translated by William Muss-Arnolt
1901

With the exception of Column I the text of this tablet is preserved almost completely. Gilgamesh is introduced as the ruler of Uruk, but his rule soon became unpopular, since he compelled all the young men of the city to enter his service, and carried off the maidens to his court. The parents complained, saying:

Not does Gilgamesh leave the son to his father,
nor the maiden to the warrior, nor the wife to her husband.
Their wailing and lament [is heard everywhere?].
"Ye gods of heaven, and thou Bel of Uruk,
who didst bring my son into existence, [save us!?],
He (Gilgamesh) has not a rival [in all the land?]
Thy people now come [to thee for help?].
Gilgamesh leaves not to the father his child." Day and night [they poured out their plaint]:
"He the ruler of Uruk the strong-walled.
He their ruler and
the strong, the lofty, the cunning [* * *]
Gilgamesh does not leave a daughter to [her mother?]
nor the maiden to the warrior, nor the wife to her husband."
[The gods of heaven] heard their cry.
They also cried aloud to Aruru, the goddess, saying: "Aruru, who hast created him,
Create now a rival (?) to him, for the time when his heart shall be [* * *],
Let them fight together and Uruk [shall be the spectator?]!"
Upon hearing this Aruru created in her heart a man after the likeness of Anu.
Aruru washed her hands, took a bit of clay, and cast it on the ground.
Thus she created Enkidu, the hero, a lofty offspring, the possession (?) of Ninib.
His whole body was covered with hair; he had long hair on his head Tike a woman;
His flowing hair was luxuriant like that of the corn-god.
Contrary to [?] the custom of the people and of the land, he was clothed with garments, as god Ner; 
He ate herbs with the gazelles.
He quenched his thirst with the beasts.
He sported about with the creatures of the water.
Sa-a-a-du, the hunter of men.
Lay in wait for him at the entrance to the well.
The first, the second, and the third day he lay in wait for
him at the entrance to the well.
But when he saw him the hunter's face looked troubled, 
[beholding Enkidu and?] his cattle, and he returned to his home.
* * * he was sad, and moaned, and wailed; 
his heart grew heavy], his face became clouded, 
and sadness [entered] into his mind. 
His face became like unto [the distant * * * (?)] 

The hunter, obeying the command of Gilgamesh, intended to advance against Enkidu; but at the sight of him he drew back in fear, and was unable to catch him.

The hunter opened his mouth and said unto [Ea, or Shamash, his father?]: 
"My father, one hero, going there [is not strong enough?]. 
In heaven is * * *
Like that of a Kisir Anuis his strength; 
he roams over [all] the mountains; 
with the beasts of the field he regularly [feeds]. 
His feet are regularly set toward the entrance of the well. 
I am afraid of him, I do not dare to go near him. 
He has filled up the pit that I digged, 
and has destroyed the hunter's nets which I [had spread over it?]. 
From my hands he has made to escape the cattle and the beasts of the field,
and does not allow me to hunt them."
His father opened his mouth and] spoke thus to the hunter: 
["Go and wend thy way] to Uruk, the city of Gilgamesh.

The fragments of lines following show that the hunter was to find there a tempter called Shamhat, in order to entice, with her assistance, the sensuous Enkidu, and bring him to Uruk. Obeying the advice of his father, the hunter goes to Uruk [the city of Gilgamesh].

Into the presence] of Gilgamesh [stepped the hunter, and said:] 

And now follows a repetition of the same report of the hunter concerning his failure to capture Enkidu, the address " my father," of course, being omitted. Thereupon:

Gilgamesh spoke to the hunter and said:
"Go, hunter mine, and take the ensnarer Shamhat with thee.
And when the beasts come down to the well,
then let her tear off her dress and disclose her nakedness.
Enkidu will see her, and he shall approach unto her,
and the cattle, which gather around him on the field, shall forsake him."
The hunter departed, and took with him the woman Shamhat.
Together they proceeded straightway, and
On the third day they reached the appointed field.
There the hunter and the ensnarer rested at their seat.
One day, two days, they lurked at the entrance to the well,
where the cattle were accustomed to slake their thirst,
where the creatures of the waters were sporting.
Then [came] Enkidu, whose home was the mountains,
who with gazelles ate herbs,
and with the cattle slaked his thirst,
and with the creatures of the waters rejoiced his heart.
And Shamhat, the enticer of men, beheld him * * *
"Behold, there he is"  (the hunter exclaimed); "now disclose thy womb,
uncover thy nakedness, and let him enjoy thy favours.
Be not ashamed, but yield to his sensuous lust.
He shall see thee and shall approach unto thee; 
Remove thy garment, and he shall lie in thine arms; 
satisfy his desire after the manner of women; 
then his cattle, raised with him on the field, shall forsake him
while he firmly presses his breast upon thine." 
And Shamhat disclosed her womb, uncovered her nakedness, and let him enjoy her favours.
She was not ashamed, but yielded to his sensuous lust. 
She removed her garment, he lay in her arms, 
and she satisfied his desire after the manner of women. 
He pressed his breast firmly upon hers. 
For six days and seven nights Enkidu enjoyed the love of Shamhat.
And when he had sated himself with her charms, 
he turned his countenance toward his cattle. 
The gazelles, resting, beheld Enkidu; they and 
the cattle of the field turned away from him. 
This startled Enkidu and his body grew faint; 
his knees became stiff, as his cattle departed, 
and he became less agile than ever before. 
And as he hearkened, he made a resolve. 
He turned again, in love enthralled, to the feet of the harlot, 
and gazed up into the face of the ensnarer. 
And while the ensnarer spoke, his ears listened attentively; 
and the siren spoke to Enkidu and said: 
"Lofty thou art, Enkidu, thou shalt be like a god;Why, then, doest thou lie down with the beasts of the field? 
Come, I will take thee to strong-walled Uruk; 
to the glorious house, the dwelling of Anu and Ishtar, 
the palace of Gilgamesh, (the hero) who is perfect in strength,
surpassing, like a mountain bull, men in power." 
While she spoke thus to him, he hearkened unto her 
wise speech, and his heart yearned for a friend.
And Enkidu spoke unto her, the ensnarer:
"Come then, Shamhat, take me, and lead me
to the glorious dwelling, the sacred seat of Anu and Ishtar,
to the palace * of Gilgamesh, (the hero) who is perfect in
strength, surpassing, like as a mountain bull, men in power."

Here the text becomes very broken, only the latter half of a number of lines being preserved. As to the contents, this much may be said: Enkidu intends to test the strength of the famous hero (Gilgamesh)—whose friendship he desires—by means of a "lion, born in the desert and powerful in strength." New fragments found and skilfully placed together by Professor Haupt, have enabled Dr. Jeremias to partially restore the following narrative:

The Shamhat leads Enkidu to Uruk. As they arrived, the inhabitants of Uruk, clothed "in festive garments," were celebrating a festival—perhaps the Tammuz festival. The end of Col. V seems to be a warning to Enkidu, received in a dream:

"Gilgamesh will behold [thee].
I behold [* * *] his face,
it glows with heroic courage.
Strength he possesses, [magnificent?] is his whole body.
His power is stronger than thine.
He rests not [nor tires?], neither by day nor by night.
O Enkidu, change thy [intention?].
Shamash loves Gilgamesh;
Anu, Bel, and Ea are whispering (wisdom) into his ear.
Ere thou earnest down from the mountain
Gilgamesh beheld thee in a dream in Uruk."

Here the address seems to end, and the narrative returns to its hero, Gilgamesh, who also had a dream, and was troubled because he could not interpret it.

Gilgamesh came, to understand the dream, and said to his mother:
"My mother, I dreamed a dream in my nightly vision; 
The stars of heaven, like Ami's host, fell upon me * * *"

The fragments of Col. VI contain another dream, the subject of which is likewise Enkidu and his adventures with the ensnarer Shamhat. The fragments indicate that the mother advised her son to make friendship with Enkidu, the giant. [i.e., wild man.]

[Here let us append the Pennsylvania tablet, covering the dream material and encounter with Shamhat found after the publication of this translation:]

Gilgamesh sought to interpret the dream;
Spoke to his mother:
“My mother, during my night
I became strong and moved about
among the heroes;
And from the starry heaven
A meteor(?) of Anu fell upon me:
I bore it and it grew heavy upon me,
I became weak and its weight I could not endure.
The land of Uruk gathered about it.
The heroes kissed its feet.
It was raised up before me.
They stood me up.
I bore it and carried it to thee.”
The mother of Gilgamesh, who knows all things,
Spoke to Gilgamesh:
“Some one, O Gilgamesh, who like thee
In the field was born and
Whom the mountain has reared,
Thou wilt see (him) and [like a woman(?)] thou wilt rejoice.
Heroes will kiss his feet.
Thou wilt spare [him and wilt endeavor]
To lead him to me.”
He slept and saw another
Dream, which he reported to his mother:
[“My mother,] I have seen another
[Dream.] My likeness I have seen in the streets
[Of Uruk] of the plazas.
An axe was brandished, and
They gathered about him;
And the axe made him angry.
I saw him and I rejoiced,
I loved him as a woman,
I embraced him.
I took him and regarded him
As my brother.”
The mother of Gilgamesh, who knows all things,
[Spoke to Gilgamesh]:
[“O Gilgamesh, the man whom thou sawest,]
[Whom thou didst embrace like a woman].
(means) that he is to be associated with thee.”
Gish understood the dream.
[As] Enki[du] was sitting before the woman,
[Her] loins(?) he embraced, her vagina(?) he opened.
[Enkidu] forgot the place where he was born.
Six days and seven nights
Enkidu continued
To cohabit with [the courtesan].
[The woman] opened her [mouth] and
Spoke to Enkidu:
“I gaze upon thee, O Enkidu, like a god art thou!
Why with the cattle
Dost thou [roam] across the field? 
Come, let me lead thee
into [Uruk] of the plazas,
to the holy house, the dwelling of Anu,
O, Enkidu arise, let me conduct thee
To Eanna, the dwelling of Anu,
The place [where Gilgamesh is, perfect] in vitality.
And thou [like a wife wilt embrace] him.
Thou [wilt love him like] thyself.
Come, arise from the ground
(that is) cursed.”
He heard her word and accepted her speech.
The counsel of the woman
Entered his heart.
She stripped off a garment,
Clothed him with one.
Another garment
She kept on herself.
She took hold of his hand.
Like [a god(?)] she brought him
To the fertile meadow,
The place of the sheepfolds.
In that place they received food;
[For he, Enkidu, whose birthplace was the mountain,]
[With the gazelles he was accustomed to eat herbs,]
[With the cattle to drink water,]
[With the water beings he was happy.]
(Perhaps one additional line missing.)
Milk of the cattle
He was accustomed to suck.
Food they placed before him,
He broke (it) off and looked
And gazed. 
Enkidu had not known
To eat food.
To drink wine
He had not been taught.
The woman opened her mouth and
Spoke to Enkidu:
“Eat food, O Enkidu,
The provender of life!
Drink wine, the custom of the land!”
Enkidu ate food
Till he was satiated.
Wine he drank,
Seven goblets.
His spirit was loosened, he became hilarious.
His heart became glad and
His face shone.
[The barber(?)] removed
The hair on his body.
He was anointed with oil.
He became manlike.
He put on a garment,
He was like a man.
He took his weapon;
Lions he attacked,
(so that) the night shepherds could rest.
He plunged the dagger;
Lions he overcame.
The great [shepherds] lay down;
Enkidu was their protector.
The strong man,
The unique hero,
To [the shepherds(?)] he speaks:

(About thirteen lines missing.)

Making merry.
He lifted up his eyes,
He sees the man. 
He spoke to the woman:
“O, courtesan, lure on the man.
Why has he come to me?
His name I will destroy.”
The woman called to the man
Who approaches to him and he beholds him.
 “Away! why dost thou [quake(?)]
Evil is the course of thy activity.”
Then he opened his mouth and
Spoke to Enkidu:
“[To have (?)] a family home
Is the destiny of men, and
The prerogative(?) of the nobles.
For the city(?) load the workbaskets!
Food supply for the city lay to one side!
For the King of Uruk of the plazas,
Open the hymen(?), perform the marriage act!
For Gilgamesh, the King of Uruk of the plazas,
Open the hymen(?),
Perform the marriage act!
With the legitimate wife one should cohabit.
So before,
As well as in the future.
By the decree pronounced by a god,
From the cutting of his umbilical cord
(Such) is his fate.”
At the speech of the hero
His face grew pale.

(About nine lines missing.) 

[Enkidu] went [in front],
And the courtesan behind him.
He entered into Uruk of the plazas.
The people gathered about him.
As he stood in the streets
Of Uruk of the plazas,
The men gathered,
Saying in regard to him:
 “Like the form of Gilgamesh he has suddenly become;
shorter in stature.
 [In his structure high(?)], powerful,
.......... overseeing(?)
In the land strong of power has he become.
Milk of cattle
He was accustomed to suck.”
Steadily(?) in Uruk .....
The heroes rejoiced.
He became a leader.
To the hero of fine appearance,
To Gilgamesh, like a god,
He became a rival to him.
For Ishtar a couch
Was stretched, and
Gilgamesh [lay down, and afterwards(?)]
In the night he fled.
He approaches and
[Enkidu stood] in the streets.
He blocked the path
of Gilgamesh.
At the exhibit of his power,

(About seven lines missing.) 

Strong(?) …
Gilgamesh
Against him [Enkidu proceeded],
[His hair] luxuriant.
He started [to go]
Towards him.
They met in the plaza of the district.
Enkidu blocked the gate
With his foot,
Not permitting Gilgamesh to enter.
They seized (each other), like oxen,
They fought.
The threshold they demolished;
The wall they impaired.
Gilgamesh and Enkidu
Seized (each other).
Like oxen they fought.
The threshold they demolished;
The wall they impaired.
Gilgamesh bent
His foot to the ground,
His wrath was appeased,
His breast was quieted.
When his breast was quieted,
Enkidu to him
Spoke, to Gilgamesh:
“As a unique one, thy mother
bore thee.
The wild cow of the stall,
Ninsun,
Has exalted thy head above men.
Kingship over men
Enlil has decreed for thee.
